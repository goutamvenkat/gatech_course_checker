#Georgia Tech Course Checker

At the moment, it is hard to find whether a required course is offered in a given semester. Also students want to find the prof with the best GPA. This requires three websites. The purpose of this project is to centralize these queries. 

Gives top x number of professors who teach a particular course in a particular semester. If professor is not found on [critique](critique.gatech.edu), then rating will be shown.
